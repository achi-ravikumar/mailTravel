1: These scripts successfuly executed on Chrome, Safari, Firefox. Could not run on IE as I am using MAC so not able to run on IE.

2: There are ways to run on IE (if you are using MAC) or ways to run on Safari (if you are using Windows).
  a: Browser stack.
  b: virtual machines
  c: Sauce labs
  d: Using Jenkins nodes/machines.

3: Used different types of elements. Xpath, Id, Name, CSS. Even some places I can use ID but used XPath to show that we can use all types of elements.

4: Used different types of Waits.

5: Another approach to implement the framework is hooks implementation.
   we can run using hooks.java and Browsers.java files. -> Commented out.

6: To run UI. Add  -Dbrowser=chrome -Denv=prod  -> to run edit config -> Added Screenshot.
    Right click on 'TestRunnerAPI' and select RUN.
